# INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

Terribly nerve wracking when done under pressure. Cathartic when done on the couch. These are the interviews questions I loved or hated to attempt to solve. Well, some I just liked and did here though I've never seen them in _the wild_.

Please feel free to mock or improve upon my solutions.
